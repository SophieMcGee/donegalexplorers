## Validator Testing

All HTML pages were run through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). See the results in the table below:

During the HTML validation process, some warnings were were identified and resolved. One rror was related to the use of aria-label attributes, particularly on elements that already contained descriptive text. This was corrected by removing unnecessary aria-label attributes where the visual text was sufficient for accessibility. Additionally, the validator flagged potential heading hierarchy problems, prompting updates to ensure that the correct heading levels (h1, h2, etc.) were used consistently in some templates, improving both readability and accessibility for screen readers.

### CSS Testing

All custom CSS files code was validated using the W3C CSS Validator. No errors were found during the validation process, confirming that the CSS complies with modern web standards and is free from any syntactical issues. This ensures that the website's styling is both well-structured and compatible across different browsers and devices.

### Javascript Testing

All custom Javascript code was validated using the JShint Validator. No errors were found during the validation process, with code confirmed to be functioning correctly without any issues across all tested templates and functionalities.

### Python Testing

During the validation of the Python files using PEP8 standards, several issues were identified, mostly related to line length, whitespace, and indentation. Common errors included E501 line too long, where lines exceeded the recommended 79 characters in length, and W293 for blank lines containing unnecessary whitespace. Additionally, E302 errors were flagged for missing blank lines between functions, and E128 continuation line under-indented for visual indent errors occurred when lines were not indented correctly for readability.

To fix these errors, long lines were broken into multiple lines and indented properly for clarity. Additionally, unnecessary trailing and leading whitespaces were removed, and blank lines were adjusted to follow the two-line spacing rule between class or function definitions. These corrections brought the Python code into compliance with PEP8 standards, improving both the structure and readability of the code.

An example of the validation confirmation for the views.py file can be seen below.
