During the HTML validation process, some warnings were were identified and resolved. One rror was related to the use of aria-label attributes, particularly on elements that already contained descriptive text. This was corrected by removing unnecessary aria-label attributes where the visual text was sufficient for accessibility. Additionally, the validator flagged potential heading hierarchy problems, prompting updates to ensure that the correct heading levels (h1, h2, etc.) were used consistently in some templates, improving both readability and accessibility for screen readers.

### CSS Testing

All custom CSS files code was validated using the W3C CSS Validator. No errors were found during the validation process, confirming that the CSS complies with modern web standards and is free from any syntactical issues. This ensures that the website's styling is both well-structured and compatible across different browsers and devices.

### Javascript Testing

All custom Javascript code was validated using the JShint Validator. No errors were found during the validation process, with code confirmed to be functioning correctly without any issues across all tested templates and functionalities.

![JSHint Validator](docs/readme_images/js-validator.png)


### Python Testing

During the validation of the Python files using PEP8 standards, several issues were identified, mostly related to line length, whitespace, and indentation. Common errors included E501 line too long, where lines exceeded the recommended 79 characters in length, and W293 for blank lines containing unnecessary whitespace. Additionally, E302 errors were flagged for missing blank lines between functions, and E128 continuation line under-indented for visual indent errors occurred when lines were not indented correctly for readability.

To fix these errors, long lines were broken into multiple lines and indented properly for clarity. Additionally, unnecessary trailing and leading whitespaces were removed, and blank lines were adjusted to follow the two-line spacing rule between class or function definitions. These corrections brought the Python code into compliance with PEP8 standards, improving both the structure and readability of the code.

An example of the validation confirmation for the views.py file can be seen below.

## Responsivity Tests

Throughout the development of the Donegal Explorers website, extensive testing was conducted to ensure its responsive design across various devices. Using Chrome Dev Tools, I simulated different screen sizes and orientations to verify that all elements, including navigation, event listings, and user forms, displayed correctly and functioned seamlessly on a wide range of devices. This testing process was integrated into the development workflow to maintain consistent layout and functionality across screen sizes.

Upon completion, additional testing was conducted using the Responsinator tool to evaluate the site's performance on different browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. The site was assessed for screen widths starting at 280 pixels, confirming that there were no issues with stretching, pixelation, or horizontal scrolling. All components, including images, buttons, and text, aligned as expected, maintaining visual integrity and usability on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

To further ensure responsive behavior, manual tests were performed on physical devices such as smartphones and tablets. This helped validate touch interactions, button sizes, and overall layout, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience across all platforms.

The results of these tests, including the range of screen sizes tested, confirm that the Donegal Explorers site adapts effectively to a variety of devices and screen resolutions.

## Accessibility Testing

Accessibility testing was a key focus throughout the development of the **Donegal Explorers** website to ensure a welcoming and inclusive experience for all users, particularly those utilising assistive technologies. The following key criteria were addressed to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and enhance usability:

1. **Colour Contrast**: The contrast between text and background colors was carefully checked to meet WCAG 2.1 standards. This ensures readability for users with visual impairments, particularly those with color blindness or low vision. Tools like Chrome DevTools and WebAIM contrast checker were used to verify that all colors across the site met the minimum contrast ratio guidelines.

2. **Heading Structure**: A clear and logical heading hierarchy was implemented across all pages. This helps users who rely on screen readers to navigate and understand the structure of the content easily. The appropriate use of headings also enhances the overall accessibility by allowing users to quickly jump between sections of the page.

3. **Semantic HTML and Landmark Elements**: Content was structured using semantic HTML5 elements such as `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to create logical divisions. These elements assist users of screen readers by providing meaningful navigation cues, allowing them to understand and explore the content more effectively.

4. **Alt Text for Images**: Every image, including icons and buttons, is equipped with descriptive alternative text (alt text). This provides essential context for users relying on screen readers. For decorative images, null alt text (`alt=""`) was used to ensure that screen readers skip over these elements, preventing unnecessary clutter in the auditory experience.

5. **ARIA Attributes**: Appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes were applied to interactive elements. This ensures that users with disabilities can understand and interact with the website. Elements such as buttons, links, and form fields have `aria-labels`, ensuring that screen readers provide clear instructions to users on how to operate these controls.

6. **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements, such as forms, links, and buttons, were tested to ensure they are fully navigable via the keyboard. This allows users who cannot use a mouse to interact with the website easily and effectively.

7. **Form Accessibility**: Forms across the website, including the event submission and login forms, have clear labels and validation messages to ensure that users with cognitive or visual impairments can complete forms without confusion. Error messages are prominently displayed and associated with their respective fields using `aria-describedby` and form validation attributes.

8. **Accessible Controls**: Dropdowns, navigation links, and other interactive elements were thoroughly tested for screen reader accessibility and were labeled with ARIA attributes where necessary. This ensures that users who rely on screen readers can easily access and interact with the website's features, such as browsing events, managing notifications, and saving events to their calendar.

9. **Language Declaration**: The `lang="en"` attribute was set in the HTML document to specify that the content is in English. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies interpret the content accurately and pronounce it correctly.

These accessibility features were rigorously tested using tools such as Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, and the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool. Additionally, manual testing with screen readers like NVDA and keyboard-only navigation was conducted to ensure that all users, regardless of ability, can fully engage with and enjoy the Donegal Explorers platform.

## Automated Testing

Automated testing was implemented to validate the functionality of both the forms and views within the Donegal Explorers project. Testing focused on verifying that various forms behave as expected when submitted, with appropriate validation and error handling, while also ensuring that views rendered correctly and returned the expected HTTP responses.

### Forms Testing
For the forms,  a set of tests were created to ensure that each form correctly validated the provided input, flagged missing or invalid data, and handled the submission process effectively. Specifically:

- **EventForm** was tested for valid and invalid submissions, ensuring that required fields like title, description, and dates were present and correctly formatted. Tests also verified that events with invalid date ranges or times were flagged as invalid.
- **CommentForm** was tested to ensure that comments were correctly validated and that an empty comment field would trigger the appropriate error.
- **NotificationPreferencesForm** and **NotificationSettingsForm** were tested to verify the proper handling of user notification preferences. Tests confirmed that the forms defaulted to sensible values and behaved correctly whether or not data was provided.

#### Key Results:
- No errors or issues were found during the form tests.
- All forms behaved as expected, validating and submitting data correctly.

### Views Testing
Views were thoroughly tested to ensure they returned the correct templates and HTTP responses when accessed. The tests covered:

- **Home Page View**, **Browse Events View**, **Event Detail View**, and other key pages, confirming they loaded successfully with the appropriate status codes (`200 OK`) and rendered the correct templates.
- **Event Creation, Update, and Deletion Views**, ensuring the creation, editing, and deletion of events functioned properly and redirected to the appropriate pages after successful actions.
- **Calendar Views**, such as saving and removing events from a userâ€™s calendar, were tested to confirm the correct handling of calendar-related actions.
- **Notification Views**, ensuring that notifications were marked as read and displayed correctly.

#### Key Results:
- All views returned the correct HTTP status codes and templates.
- Interaction with views, such as creating events and saving to the calendar, behaved as expected with no errors.

The automated tests provided comprehensive coverage of both forms and views, ensuring that the applicationâ€™s core functionality was reliable and that no errors were encountered during testing.
