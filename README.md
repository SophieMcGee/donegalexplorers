# **_Donegal Explorers - Project Portfolio 4_**

This document provides an overview of the Donegal Explorers website I have developed using Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to offer a digital platform where users can browse, add, and manage events happening in Donegal. This website allows event organisers to promote their events while giving local residents an easy way to discover upcoming activities, plan their schedules, and engage with the community. With user authentication, event submission, and notifications, Donegal Explorers aims to build an interactive space to connect people with local events.

The live site can be viewed here - <a href="https://donegal-explorers-22a6c2ed48a2.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donegal Explorers</a>
